# claim check pattern
It seems like you are interested in implementing a service acknowledgment (ack) poll pattern for file uploads in AWS Lambda using Python. 
The claim check pattern involves returning a claim check immediately, allowing the client to later poll for the status or result.
Here's a simplified example using AWS Lambda, S3, and the claim check pattern

# Triggering the Polling Lambda:
You can trigger the polling Lambda function periodically or based on your specific requirements. You might set up an external process (e.g., another Lambda function, AWS Step Functions, or an event scheduler) to trigger the polling function.

Make sure to replace 'your-s3-bucket-name' with the actual name of your S3 bucket.

This example demonstrates a simple claim check pattern using AWS Lambda and S3. Depending on your use case and requirements, you might need to adjust and enhance the implementation.
