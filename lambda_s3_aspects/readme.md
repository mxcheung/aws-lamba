CDK Aspects use the Visitor Pattern.


Using a custom aspect, 
you can automatically apply VPC configurations to all Lambda functions that meet certain criteria. 
In this case, weâ€™ll attach the VPC configuration to Lambda functions as required.

Interface appears to adopt vistor pattern
```
// Custom aspect to enforce VPC on Lambda functions to traverse nodes or constructs.
class LambdaVpcAspect implements cdk.IAspect {

  visit(node: IConstruct): void {
    if (node instanceof lambda.Function) {

```
